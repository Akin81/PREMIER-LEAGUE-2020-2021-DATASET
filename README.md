# PREMIER-LEAGUE-2020-2021-DATASET


INTRODUCTION
I sourced the 2020/2021 dataset from Kaggle.com, imported into my notebook using pandas library. I carried out a thorough assessment on the dataset to check the shape, description, null value to extract useful information for meaningful insight.



Here, there were no null values and I went ahead to visualize my data via matplotlib and seaborn libraries.




INSIGHTS
•	35% of the productive premier league players fall between the age of 20 to 30 years, so clubs are advised to be cautious of sighing players above the age of 30.

•	Manchester City have the total number of assists and goals, meaning that they have the strongest attackers  the premiership in 2020/2021 season.

•	Hary kane has the total number of assists per match.

•	Out of the total goals scored, goals with assists cover 69%, meaning clubs should understand strikers alone cannot get the job done. Other wings are equally important.
